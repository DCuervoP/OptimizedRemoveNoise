This project focuses on the task of noise reduction in datasets. In R, a signal is analyzed, and based on a cost function, the results are examined by modifying various optimization methods and their hyperparameters. Additionally, a two-dimensional image is analyzed using the same methodology.
This project is part of the Numerical Optimization and Data Science course at Sorbonne University
